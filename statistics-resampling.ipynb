    "Interact with Octave and the statistics-resampling package online in Jupyter Notebook with Binder. All commands are interpreted by Octave.  Since this is a [MetaKernel](https://github.com/Calysto/metakernel), a standard set of magics are available.  Help on commands is available using the `%help` magic or using `?` with a command.\n",

    "Follow the links in the 'Quick start' section of the [README page](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/readme.html), or on the [Function reference page](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/function_reference), to find some examples relevant to you that can be copy-and-pasted below and updated with your own data. For the best experience, run this notebook in [JupyterLab](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?labpath=statistics-resampling.ipynb).\n",

    "To see a list of other Octave packages already installed, use the command `pkg list`. To load `<package-name>`, use the command `pkg load <package-name>`, being sure to replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you wish to load. Visit this [webpage](https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/) to see what packages are available for GNU Octave and how to install them.\n",
