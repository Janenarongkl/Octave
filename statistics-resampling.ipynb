    "Interact with Octave and the statistics-resampling package online in Jupyter Notebook with Binder. All commands are interpreted by Octave.  Since this is a [MetaKernel](https://github.com/Calysto/metakernel), a standard set of magics are available.  Help on commands is available using the `%help` magic or using `?` with a command.\n",

    "Follow the links in the 'Quick start' section of the [README page](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/readme.html), or on the [Function reference page](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/function_reference), to find some examples relevant to you that can be copy-and-pasted below and updated with your own data. To quickly preview demo number `X` of a function called `<function-name>`, enter the command `demo ('<function-name>', X)`. To execute code contained in a cell, mouse-click inside the relevant cell and the run button in the toolbar. \n",
