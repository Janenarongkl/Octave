# statistics-resampling-online

Try the statistics-resampling package online in a Notebook with an Octave kernel within Jupyter Lab using Binder by clicking the launch-binder button:

Note that the first time you access statistics-resampling online (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it may take a while to build, but frequent access to statistics-resampling-online thereon should give load times less than a minute. Data files (.tsv and .csv) can be conveniently modified using the [jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor.html) included in this environment. The environment also includes kernels to run workbooks in **R**, **Python** and **Julia** (in which additional packages and modules can be installed from CRAN, with pip, or with Pkg respectively). Pre-built [conda-forge packages](https://conda-forge.org/packages/) can also be installed from code cells within a notebook using a Python kernel and the `conda install -qc conda-forge` command.

You could consider loading Jupyter notebooks and data files from your own GitHub repositories using this Binder environment with the help of the [nbgitpuller link generator](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html?tab=binder). This Binder repository is `nbgitpuller` enabled, so you can use it's environment (and it's image if it exists already) to load content (e.g. notebooks and data) from your own GitHub repository (for an example, see [![](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-project?label=GitHub%20Repo&amp;style=social)](https://github.com/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-project/)). Alternatively, you could fork this repository or use it as a template for you own GitHub repository. 

If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/). The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found at the following link:
