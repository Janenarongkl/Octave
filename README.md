# statistics-resampling-online

Try the statistics-resampling (and statistics) package online in a Notebook with an Octave kernel within Jupyter Lab using Binder by clicking the launch-binder button:

Note that the first time you load access statistics-resampling online (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it will take a while to build the docker image, but subsequent access to statistics-resampling online will take less than a minute or so.

You could consider forking the statistics-resampling-online GitHub repository and customizing the notebook (.ipynb) and data (.tsv and .csv) files to document and publish your data analysis project. The example data files can be conveniently modified using the spreadsheet extension included here in Jupyter Lab.

The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found [here](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/index.html). If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/).

The docker image also includes kernels to run workbooks in R and Python (in which additional packages and modules can be installed from CRAN and with pip respectively).
