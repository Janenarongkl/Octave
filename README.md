# statistics-resampling-online

Try the statistics-resampling (and statistics) package online in a Notebook with an Octave kernel within Jupyter Lab using Binder by clicking the launch-binder button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?labpath=statistics-resampling.ipynb)

Note that the first time you load access statistics-resampling online (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it will take a while to build the docker image, but subsequent access to statistics-resampling online will take less than a minute or so.

The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found [here](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/index.html). If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/).

You could consider forking the statistics-resampling-online GitHub repository, changing the link in the launch-binder button with the help of this [tool](https://mybinder.org/), and customizing the notebook (.ipynb) and data (.tsv and .csv) files to document and publish your data analysis project. The example data files can be conveniently modified using the [jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/jupyterlab-spreadsheet-editor.html) included in the environment. The environment also includes kernels to run workbooks in R and Python (in which additional packages and modules can be installed from CRAN and with pip respectively).
