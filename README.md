Note that the first time you load access statistics-resampling online (since the last commit at the GitHub repository) it will take a few minutes to build the docker image, but subsequent access to statistics-resampling online will only take a few of seconds.

You could consider forking and customizing the statistics-resampling-online GitHub repository to document and publish your data analysis project.

The documentation for the statistics-resampling package can be found [here](https://gnu-octave.github.io/statistics-resampling/index.html). If you wish to download and use the package offline, you can find the package source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/).
